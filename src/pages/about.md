## 👋 Hello, I’m Viral

I'm a Machine Learning Engineer, lifelong learner, and teacher at heart. My work blends engineering, research, and product thinking — turning ideas into real, usable systems. I enjoy building things that are practical, minimal, and meaningful.

This site is my digital home — a place to document:
- Projects I'm working on
- Lessons from experiments (and failures)
- Reflections on engineering, learning, and life

## 🧠 What I Care About

- **Applied ML** — especially computer vision, NLP, generative AI, and self-supervised learning  
- **Simplicity** — in design, code, and communication  
- **Teaching** — I mentor and coach, and believe sharing knowledge is a multiplier  
- **Productivity** — systems, habits, and workflows that make space for deep work  
- **Curiosity** — I'm always learning, often by doing and sometimes by writing about it

## 💻 My Stack

- **Languages**: Python, Bash, JavaScript  
- **ML**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-Learn  
- **Infra**: AWS, Ray, Docker  
- **Other**: Astro, Markdown, VS Code, Notion

## 🛠 Current Projects

- Leading ML initiatives at work around content understanding  
- Writing weekly posts on engineering and learning  
- Learning to draw with Sharpies & Sticky Notes for fun ✏️  
- Slowly building this site into a digital garden 🌱
