## Hello, I’m Viral

I'm a Machine Learning Development Manager at Autodesk, a lifelong learner, and a teacher at heart. My work blends engineering, research, and leadership — turning ideas into scalable, impactful ML systems. I enjoy building things that are practical, minimal, and meaningful.

This site is my digital home — a place to document:
- Projects I'm working on
- Lessons from experiments (and failures)
- Reflections on engineering, learning, and life

## What I Care About

- **Applied ML** — especially computer vision, NLP, generative AI, and self-supervised learning  
- **Simplicity** — in design, code, processes, and communication  
- **Teaching & Mentorship** — I actively mentor and teach, and believe sharing knowledge multiplies impact  
- **ML Infrastructure** — building robust pipelines and evaluation frameworks  
- **Curiosity** — I’m always learning, experimenting, and connecting dots across disciplines

## My Stack

- **Languages**: Python, C++, JavaScript  
- **ML Frameworks**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, JAX, Scikit-Learn  
- **Platforms**: AWS SageMaker, GCP Vertex AI, OpenAI  
- **Infra**: Docker, AWS SAM, TensorRT, TFServing, Flask  
- **Boards**: NVIDIA Jetson, Raspberry Pi, Arduino
